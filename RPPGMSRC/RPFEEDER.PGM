      *  MD058809 - After installation of MQ9 compatibility patch and *
      *             restart of the Meridian Replication subsystem     * 
      *             REPMIDASPT, the job MPT1PBSIN ended in MSGW.      *      
      *  SFDC01648961/PMS-9791 -                                      *
      *             If two Replication systems are pointed at the     *
      *             same database, then the '01' journal entry sent   *
      *             by ENDRPNFDR causes both feeders to end (as you   *
      *             would expect if you think about it). Change to    *
      *             include the subsystem name as part of the         *
      *             entry-specific data, and only end if the '01'     *
      *             is for the current system.                        *
      *                                                               *
      *  PMS-8870 - Need to increase the maximum size of journal      *
      *             entries buffer again. Wanted to go from 2048      *
      *             to 4096, but doing that blows the limit on the    *
      *             size of a data element (16,773,104 bytes).        *
      *             So I've set the value of BuffArrSizeLg to         *
      *             2342, which is as high as it can go and still     *
      *             let the module compile.                           *
      *                                                               *
      *  582747 - An Equation file now has a record length of over    *
      *           5000, which causes us to have a string index out    *
      *           of range.  Increased the maximum length to 6000.    *
      *           Also had to tweak some other lengths to match.      *
      *                                                               *
      *  477879 - Shut down Feeder only if it was our program that    *
      *           wrote the entry in the journal.                     *
